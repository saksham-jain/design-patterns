STEPS--
- Happy flow.
- Requirements.
- Object identification.
- design pattern if any.
- service objects -> if any complex business logic is present in model, its better to take it out in service object.
- controller objects -> if complex coordination required between different modules better to use controller objects and use these in driver file. simply put use when driver logic becoming repeatable and complex.
TIPS-- 
- focus more on modularity, extensibility and reusability, if time left then think about design patterns. 
- if time permits discuss more about exception handling, edge cases, multithreading, background jobs, algorithm optimizations(if any).
